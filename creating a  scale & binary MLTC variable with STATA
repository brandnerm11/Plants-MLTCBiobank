Using "First occurrences" variables from UK Biobank

These variables have the ICD code as variable title, but contain a date where there is the condition present, i.e. when it was first diagnosed

1. Creating a Categorical Variable from Date Data
To create a new variable that assigns "0" when the original variable is missing and "1" when it contains a date, you can use the generate command along with the missing() function. Here's the code to accomplish this:

generate new_variable = 0 if missing(original_variable)
replace new_variable = 1 if !missing(original_variable)

Breaking this down:
The first line creates a new variable and sets it to 0 for all observations where the original variable is missing.
The second line replaces the value with 1 for all observations where the original variable is not missing (i.e., contains a date).
If wanting to add value labels to make the output more readable, use the following additional commands:

label define date_label 0 "no" 1 "yes"
label values new_variable date_label

This will label the values 0 as "no" and 1 as "yes" in your new variable.

    2. Creating a numerical variable from categorical variabe above to sum conditions into binary or scale data
