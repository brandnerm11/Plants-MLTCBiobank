* How to import data from RAP to CSV file

STATA on Jupyter lab

run table exporter

generate a txt file of field names
do not forget to specify entity (participant)

then save it in the general folder, NOT the tabe exporter file!

Then run jupyter ntebook stata
then run 

import delimited /mnt/project/Field_names_trial.csv

then
save Field_names_trial
will save file as dta file

to upload dta file to project in order to save it
!dx upload Field_names_trial.dta

to use it
use Field_names_trial.dta, clear

when saving it
!dx upload Field_names_trial.dta

when using it after a new jupyter notebook is started
use /mnt/project/inflaimPlantsICDcodesdates.dta
