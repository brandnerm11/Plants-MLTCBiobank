# Create a txt file with unix endings

To create a text file with Unix line endings (LF instead of CRLF) from an Excel column, you'll need to use VBA. Here's a step-by-step approach:
Make sure you have all desired variables that match the selected cohort in one column, each variable name (e.g. p12321_i0) per one line/field
Open the Visual Basic Editor in Excel (press Alt + F11).
Insert a new module (Insert > Module).
Paste the following VBA code into the module:
```
Sub ExportColumnToUnixFile()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim filePath As String
    Dim fileNum As Integer
    
    ' Set the worksheet and get the last row
    Set ws = ActiveSheet
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Prompt for file path
    filePath = Application.GetSaveAsFilename(FileFilter:="Text Files (*.txt), *.txt")
    If filePath = "False" Then Exit Sub
    
    ' Open the file for writing
    fileNum = FreeFile
    Open filePath For Output As #fileNum
    
    ' Write each cell value with Unix line ending
    For i = 1 To lastRow
        Print #fileNum, ws.Cells(i, 1).Value & Chr(10);
    Next i
    
    ' Close the file
    Close #fileNum
    
    MsgBox "File exported successfully with Unix line endings.", vbInformation
End Sub
```

Run the macro by clicking in the code and pressing F5, or by creating a button on your worksheet and assigning the macro to it.
This code does the following:
1. It prompts you to choose a location and name for the output file.
2. It reads the values from column A of the active worksheet.
3. It writes each cell value to the file, followed by a line feed character (Chr(10)), which is the Unix line ending1.

Important Notes
This code assumes you want to export column A. If you need a different column, change the column letter in the lastRow calculation and the ws.Cells(i, 1) reference.
The code uses Chr(10) for the line feed character, which is the Unix line ending1.
Make sure to save your Excel workbook as a macro-enabled file (.xlsm) to retain the VBA code.
By using this method, you can easily convert an Excel column into a text file with Unix line endings, which is compatible with Unix/Linux systems
