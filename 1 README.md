## Introdution
Multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs), also named multimorbidity, are widely defined as the presence of two or more health conditions that affect an individual long term. It is estimated that about a quarter of primary care patients in the UK have multimorbidity and it is predicted that by 2035 about 2/3 of adults of 65 will be affected. This poses as challenge and burden for the health and social care system and threat to individual wellbeing. To rise to the challenge of multimorbidity more knowledge and research is needed to develop holistic care approaches addressing individual combinations of disease and their complexities. 
A common underlying pathological process in both multimorbidity and individual long-term conditions like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes or dementia is chronic inflammation. However, evidence on the role of chronic inflammation in multimorbidity and its evolution remains scarce. At the same time the risk to have multimorbidity is linked to common lifestyle risk factors, like obesity, poor nutrition and diet, smoking and alcohol consume, which have also shown associations with chronic inflammation in previous research. Starkly obvious seems the link to nutrition-dependent factors, warranting more research into the emerging role of nutrition in inflammation and ultimately multimorbidity. Further knowledge is also needed around social determinants of health and inflammation and their interaction with dietary behaviour
